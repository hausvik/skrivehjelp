# Word Add in proof of concept

Purpose is to create a word add in replace ment for the VBA code.

The MVP is a proof of concept in which:
    
1. The Add in is a form that has
    * A text field where you enter text
    * A check box
    * A run button
2. When clicking the run button, a named autotext is inserted into the document at a bookmark name.
3. The text is input into a bookmark in the text
4. If the checkbox is checked, a text is removed from the document

The initial code was greated using [Yeoman Generator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/develop/yeoman-generator-overview).
